On a fresh new instance:

1. Add the ip of new instance to the DNS esk-pj...... on the grading site

2. Add the ip of new instance to /etc/ansible/hosts

3. Run ansible-playbook playbooks/setup.yaml. this may take 5-10 minutes

4. run ansible-playbook playbooks/repo.yaml . This will install the repostiory, build the images, and run the application

5. Run ip addr on the command line. Look for "ens3" . That ip address needs to be updated in bp/auth.py on line 74. I wanted to figure out a way to do this dynamically but it was too cumbersome.

6. Attach video volume and mongodb volume to the running instance

The application should be running and accessible after a bit. It takes time for the app to build the certs from the CA and begin with HTTPS.

TODO: mount volumes to the filesystem for storing videos and the mongo data
